Here how it works:
    In src folder, run these files in this order:
    matchSep.py (Completed)
        Transform all the JSON files from open-data folder into csv files on a folder called org-data.
    treatEvents.py (Under review)
        It treats the games in the org-data folder and discard some attributes, organizing these games. The files are going to be on the proc-data folder.
    modelParse.py<-(add_features.py, add_labels.py)<-(modelParse/features.py, modelParse/labels.py) (Ongoing)
        It literally make the games model readable, it means the files are going to be made up by features and two labels (scores, and concedes)
    catboostModel.py (Ongoing)
        Train the model, using grid search and accurate evaluation metrics.
    estimatingProbabilities.py (Ongoing)
        Runs the model on all files and estimate the probabilities of scores and concedes for all actions.
    vaep.py (TBD)
        Shape all the files into more organized and readable files, with the VAEP metric calculated. By these files, some attributes are going to be sent to the SQL database.
